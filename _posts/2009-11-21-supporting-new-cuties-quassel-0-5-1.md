title: Supporting New Cuties - Quassel 0.5.1
---
We have just tagged, packaged and published a <a href="https://github.com/quassel/quassel/archive/0.5.1.tar.gz">bugfix and maintenance release</a> for the 0.5 branch. Most notably, 0.5.1 fixes some problems with the newly released Qt 4.6-rc1. Also, newly joined channels are now properly rejoined on the next core restart. The scrolling behavior on initial backlog fetch for a channel has been fixed, and some more small stuff.

This release also includes updated translations for French, Italian, and Finnish. And you'll get jussi01's dark stylesheet as a bonus!

Anyway, head over to the <a href="/downloads">downloads page</a> to grab it!
