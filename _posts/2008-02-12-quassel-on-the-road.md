title: Quassel On The Road!
---
I’m going to <a href="https://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>, the Free and Open Source Software Developers’ European Meeting!

Yep, I'll be there, probably partying with the Gentoo or Amarok people. We also plan to finally release Quassel to the public on FOSDEM. So if you like to learn more about Quassel or even see it in action, FOSDEM is your chance :)
