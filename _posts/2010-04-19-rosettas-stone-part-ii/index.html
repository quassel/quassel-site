<p>As mentioned in the previous article, we’ve been trying out <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/quassel">Launchpad/Rosetta</a> for translations for the past few months. It took us a while to get the workflow right, since Qt still uses its own translation format that nothing else uses, and conversion is shaky; but Daniel “al” Albers with some help from Kubuntu translation expert David “dpm” Planella have gotten it working at last. Thanks!</p>

<p>The results have been encouraging; we have quickly gained several new languages, and existing translations have been improved thanks to the Kubuntu translation teams.</p>

<p>However, we also still have several contributors that prefer using their own tools over having to register at Launchpad, and would like to continue to send in translations as patches. Good news: al is willing to handle those and merge them with the Rosetta contributions! It would be best to send them to &lt;translations at quassel-irc org&gt; as that gets straight to the correct person. Please make clear which branch your translation applies to, so we can make sure to apply it correctly!</p>

<p>After we have merged your translation, it will also be included in Rosetta with the next package upload, overriding whatever was there before. We’d suggest having a look at <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/quassel">Launchpad</a> first though, to check which languages are already being translated and avoid duplicating work. Or poke us in IRC and ask beforehand, if it makes sense.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you helping to make Quassel awesome in many languages!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Fixed the mail address that was eaten by Drupal, and also removed some false information about Rosetta branches (looks like it points to master now, rather than the stable branch).</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Fixed Rosetta links</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> We now also support translations via <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/quassel/">Transifex</a>. Please read <a href="/node/113">the followup blog entry</a> for more details.
