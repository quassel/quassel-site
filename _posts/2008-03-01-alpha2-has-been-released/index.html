<p>A few days later than planned, we have released <a href="https://github.com/quassel/quassel/archive/0.2.0-alpha2.tar.gz">quassel-0.2.0-alpha2</a>! We used the extra days to iron out some annoying bugs, such as the crash on first run some users experienced, and made the sync-to-core process much faster.</p>

<p>More features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sane first-run layout of dockwidgets</li>
<li>Various UI enhancements</li>
<li>Buffer switching via mousewheel (thanks Ian "eean" Monroe for the patch!)</li>
<li>Redirection of notices and server messages to the status buffer or the current buffer</li>
<li>Various bugfixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Upgrading is recommended!</p>

<p>Packages for *buntu and Debian will appear on the <a href="/downloads">downloads page</a> during the next few days, as well as updated builds for Windows and MacOSX.</p>

<p>Have fun with the shiny new -alpha2!<br />
