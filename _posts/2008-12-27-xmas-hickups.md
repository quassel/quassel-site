As many of you probably have noticed by now, we have had some server trouble right in time for christmas. We are currently in the process of restoring all services, but it will probably take us a few days. So far, we have most of the webpage running again The FAQ is still missing, and we will tweak the theme a bit I guess, as this was just a rather quick hack to make the page work at all with the new Drupal version (yes, we took the opportunity to update that). Git is back too, as are the download pages. The bug tracker is still offline and will be for a few more days probably, as we are evaluating switching to a different software.

Anyway, sorry for the inconvenience.

Merry XMas/Chanukka/Season's Greetings/Weekend and a Happy New Year :)
