<p>Well, EgS speaking of 50 commits in January until the 17th. Turned out to be 125 commits until the end of the month, and another 55 commits in the eight days of February already… development speed is increasing, and we can now see the light at the end of the tunnel (and it’s not a train coming at us). We are fighting some stability issues and we still need to fix a couple of things, but we are now very confident that we can release Quassel within the month!

So what does being on the Home Stretch feel like? It’s just nice to see all the pieces falling in place. We built up a solid foundation during the past year, and we can now reap what we’ve sown. This means that now many of the small details are being worked on, fixed and implemented, and every day Quassel gets another feature sorely missed before by me or others. We, the devs and our beta testers (a special thanks to int and adamt!), now have started using Quassel IRC as our main client more and more, which in turn leads us to focus on all the small things that are still missing. Yes, we are getting ready for prime-time!</p>

<p>We’ll keep you posted.<br />
