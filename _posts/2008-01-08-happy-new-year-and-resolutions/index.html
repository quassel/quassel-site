<p>2007 has come and gone, and now it is 2008. Last year has seen a lot of improvements in and around Quassel IRC, and we are now very close to the first releaseable version. In fact, we, the developers and some early testers/helpers/fans are running Quassel Cores on our servers to stress-test (and of course enjoy) them! We now mainly lack some features in the GUI and some improvements in internal structures to be able to release Quassel to the public.
And this is my resolution for 2008: Get Quassel IRC out of the door ASAP, and then continue to make this the bestest IRC client ever!</p>
