<p>I just switched to universal binaries, so the Mac Client will be able to run on PPC Macs as well as on the new intel ones. Get it in the “Get Quassel!” section or right <a href="/system/files/QuasselClient_MacOSX-universal_r585.dmg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Currently there is only the Client build. If you’re interessted in precompiled Mac builds for the Quassel Core or the Monolithic Quassel, then please let me know.</p>
