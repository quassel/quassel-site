<p>After all the hazzle that came with the switch from svn to git and qmake to cmake, Iâ€™m glad to tell you, that the nightly builds for Mac OS X are available again. Currently there are only Mac OS X nightlys for 0.2 but that is about to change soonish. Get them as usual at http://quassel-irc.org/nightly/macosx/</p>
