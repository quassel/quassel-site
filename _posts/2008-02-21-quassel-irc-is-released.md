title: Quassel IRC is released!
---
It is finally <a href="/downloads">here</a> - <a href="https://github.com/quassel/quassel/archive/0.2.0-alpha1.tar.gz">quassel-0.2.0-alpha1</a>, Quassel's long-awaited first public release! This is still an alpha version, so it still has some quirks, and it still lacks some features that may or may not be important for you. That said, we (the devs) have been using it as our main client for weeks now, and we are fairly happy with it, so it can't hurt to give it a try!

Only this release sets your computer on fire, eats your dog and is probably highly addictive.

If you happen to be at FOSDEM right now, you might be able to catch me near the KDE/Amarok booth, or during the Free Beer Event tonight :)

Happy Quasseling,\
