<p>It’s always amazing how easily one can be destracted from learning…
Despite having an exam next tuesday I’ve spent most of this day on fixing bugs and tweaking things for -alpha2. Sput’s already fixed one of the major bugs: the client crash during first run network setup. So what to expect from -alpha2? Actually not much more than from -alpha1. :) Find a list of the fixes and features after the jump.

<ul>
  <li>fixed a bug where the client crashes during first run network setup</li>
  <li>fixed a bug where the encoding was not correctly applied to /me-style messages</li>
  <li>fixed “ghost” buffers showing up in the “All Network” view.</li>
  <li>Notices and Messages like “no such nick or channel” can now be displayed in the status buffer, the current buffer or still the original target buffer (have a look at the general settings of your client)</li>
  <li>some cosmetic improvements (uncluttered the default client layout a bit and fixed widths of the Nicklist and Buffer Views)</li>
  <li>one can now switch buffers with the mousewheel while hovering over a bufferview (thanks to Ian “eean” Monroe for the patch)</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve added some more infos to the FAQ-Section, like some of the cool undocumented features of quassel, that came to our mind.</p>
