<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>blogging live from CeBIT, Hanover, Germant, Worlsâ€™d largest IT fair :) This time I am not promoting Quassel, but I am part of the <a href="http://amarok.kde.org">Amarok</a> Promo Team. Be sure to check out the bestest music player in the world! Still using Quassel though :) While part of the KDE and Amarok people here chose to find some restaurant and eat, sven423 and me decided to enjoy the free booth parties :) Since we have only a few more minutes until security kicks us out for good, just a few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>World's largest IT fair is unable to provide internet access during the day</li>
<li>Booth parties rock! :)</li>
<li>If you are looking for us: Hall 5, Booth E61/3</li>
<li>Pizza delivery directly to the booth works :)</li>
</ul>

<p>So much for now, hoping to get internet access tomorroy night at some point again :)</p>

<p>~ Sput</p>
