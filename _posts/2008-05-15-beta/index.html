<p>Yes, we can finally announce the release of Quassel’s very first <a href="/downloads">beta</a>! With entering the beta cycle, we also enter feature freeze for the 0.2 branch. While we are still stabilizing this branch, we are busy working on tons of new features and larger arch changes in the 0.3 branch, which we’ll probably talk about in another blog entry soon…</p>

<p>Read on for the release notes for quassel-0.2.0-beta1!
<!--break-->
There have been many bugfixes, some performance improvements and some new features. Most notably: The bufferviews are now fully customizable! You can create and edit views using the settings dialog (F7) -&gt; General -&gt; Buffer Views. Buffers can be reordered using drag’n’drop, you can hide inactive buffers and much more. All your views will be stored on the core, so you can share them amongst your clients. Please note that there currently is one known bug where new buffers will not always be shown in custom views. They are visible in the “All Buffers” view though and can be dragged from there into custom views.</p>

<p>Also nice to know is that we have now a flood protection (throttling your messages in order to prevent you from being kicked from the network), and we have fixed the huge lag that you might have experienced on some networks.</p>

<p>And now, <a href="/downloads">get it while it’s hot!</a></p>

<p>Have fun,<br />
