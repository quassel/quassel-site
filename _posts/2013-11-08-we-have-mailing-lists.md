title: We Have Mailing Lists!
---
Hi all,

finally (after years of pushing and prodding for it), we now have mailing lists for Quassel IRC.
While most of user support and discussions happens in our IRC channels (mostly #quassel on
Freenode), mailing lists have distinct advantages - in particular, there is an archive, and
people can chime in asynchronously.

So now we offer <a href="http://lists.quassel-irc.org">the following lists</a>:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.quassel-irc.org/mailman/listinfo/quassel-announce">quassel-announce</a>

This is a read-only list, where the development team will send important announcements
to. We highly recommend distro packagers to subscribe to this one, as we'll announce
releases and other important information there.
</li>

<li><a href="http://lists.quassel-irc.org/mailman/listinfo/quassel-users">quassel-users</a>

This list should be used for general user discussion about and around Quassel IRC -
questions, tips & tricks, that sort of things.
</li>

<li><a href="http://lists.quassel-irc.org/mailman/listinfo/quassel-devel">quassel-devel</a>

This list is for discussion about development of Quassel IRC itself. Everything that is related
to development should go there, and we'll share our plans and ideas there as well.
</li>
</ul>

So, feel free to go ahead and <a href="http://lists.quassel-irc.org">subscribe</a>!

Please note that this is my first time setting up a list server, so if the lists show unexpected
behavior or have configuration issues, feel free to poke me so I can fix it.
