<p>Because people keep wondering why our repository has been rather… quiet for the past few months, and not everybody finds his way into our IRC channel to ask us in person what’s up, I think it’s a good idea to finally blog about this.</p>

<p>I can assure everyone that the project isn’t dead or anything. But the main developers are currently quite busy with real life, mainly with thesis writing, and Quassel development needs to suffer for that for the next few months. We intend to get back to development full steam once these rather time-consuming commitments have been dealt with, and we still have some cool plans in store to make Quassel an even better client once we’re back!</p>

<p>In other news, we did package up 0.7.2 quite a while ago, but we’re still waiting for Windows builds, so it’s not up on the download page yet. You can get the tarball at <a href="http://quassel-irc.org/pub/quassel-0.7.2.tar.bz2">the usual location</a> though, and also find packages for Mac and the static core in <a href="http://quassel-irc.org/pub">the download dir</a>. Some distros (Gentoo, *buntu) have already been shipping 0.7.2 packages for a while as well.</p>

<p>In even further news, some exceptionally cool things are being done by some of our users. For one, there is a native (!) <a href="https://github.com/sandsmark/QuasselDroid/wiki/QuasselDroid-Wiki">Quassel client for Android devices</a> under development. QuasselDroid is still work in progress, but I’m told it’s shaping up really nicely.
For Maemo/MeeGo devices, Sandro Giessl is working on <a href="https://gitorious.org/~sgiessl/quassel/quassel2go">Quassel2Go</a>, which at present is a version of the standard client modified for small touchscreens. We intend to merge this into the upstream codebase at some point in the future, but for now he maintains his own fork.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. Stay tuned, while I go back to my thesis writing, and rest assured that Quassel will see more development again in just a few months!</p>
