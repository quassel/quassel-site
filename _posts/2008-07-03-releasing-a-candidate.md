title: Releasing a candidate
---
After being on a bugfixing spree the past couple of weeks, the Quassel Team proudly gives you our first-ever Release Candidate of what shall become quassel-0.2.0. Since the 0.2 branch has been in feature freeze for a while, you probably won't find much new stuff (except for the occasional feature that might have crept in completely unnoticed of course ;-)), but on the other hand you will also find less bugs than in the previous releases, so <a href="/downloads">grab it while it's still steaming!</a>
