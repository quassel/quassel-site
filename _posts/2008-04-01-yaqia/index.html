<p>We’ve released Yet Another Quassel IRC Alpha! Besides various bugfixes (the nick selector works again!), <a href="https://github.com/quassel/quassel/archive/0.2.0-alpha4.tar.gz">quassel-0.2.0-alpha4</a> brings you some real nice new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The backlog is now dynamically replayed from the core. This means as you scroll further up in a buffer, new backlog lines will be automagically requested and displayed. This gives you the possibility to scroll up "infinitely", well, up to the point where you first entered that channel...</li>
<li>Server passwords work now. Just enter them in the server edit dialog (Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Networks -&gt; Edit Server).</li>
<li>Highlighted messages now make your systray icon flash and/or display a shiny bubble. Configurable under Settings -&gt; Behavior -&gt; General.</li>
</ul>

<p>This release also breaks the core/client protocol (again, and it won’t be the last time), so both your core and client need to be alpha4 to work.</p>
