<p>So a couple days ago, I had a nice surprise in my mailbox:</p>

<p><img src="http://egs.name/tmp/DSC00638.jpg" alt="Nice finnish vodka" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>Sent by jussi01 all the way from Finland to Germany, as a huge Thank You for the development team :) Needless to say that, while it might not increase productivity at our next devmeeting, it surely increases the dev team’s motivation to continue to make Quassel rock!</p>

<p>Thanks a bunch jussi01, and we’re looking forward to crack that bottle open for reaching the <a href="http://xkcd.com/323/">Ballmer Peak</a> soonish :)</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, the Quassel team will be present at the Qt Developer Days in Munich next week, so if you happen to attend those, be sure to have a chat with us :)</p>
