title: Let There Be Features - Releasing Quassel IRC 0.3.1
---
After more than two months, we are finally delivering a shiny new feature release to you! The 0.3.0.x releases were only bugfix releases, based on the "ancient" 0.3.0. In the meantime, we were busy working on <a href="/pub/ChangeLog">new stuff</a> and fixing <a href="http://bugs.quassel-irc.org/changelog_page.php">tons of bugs</a>. In fact, I won't even bother listing all that stuff here, since you can just click on those links and see for yourself :) Among the features users have been waiting for for a long time and now finally get are day change messages and properly clickable URLs with visual feedback. Another highlight certainly are the on-hover previews of linked webpages.

We are quite proud of quassel-0.3.1, as we've put a lot of effort in making it a solid and stable release. So don't hesitate to grab it from our <a href="/downloads">downloads page</a> or get it from a distribution near you!
