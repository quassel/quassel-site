<p>As of now, we have switched our public repository from Subversion to Git. While Git takes some time getting used to, it makes development easier for us, and also it is hip and shiny and new - plus what’s good for Linus can’t be bad for us, eh? :)</p>

<p>You can access the public repo as follows:
<code>git clone git://git.quassel-irc.org/quassel.git</code></p>
