title: 'Another Bugfix Release: 0.5.2'
---
We have another bugfix release for the 0.5 series. Quassel-0.5.2 mostly contains build system fixes for recent versions of KDE and Qt. Some issues with netsplit handling have also been fixed. Also, if you accidentally had your menu bar vanish, you can now use the context menu on the chatview to re-enable it ;-)

For workarounding the recent flooding issues with Freenode, we have added <a href="http://bugs.quassel-irc.org/projects/quassel-irc/wiki/FAQ#How-do-I-ignore-CTCP-requests">a quick way to ignore CTCP requests</a>. Since Freenode has fixed the problem the other day, using this should no longer be necessary for now.

You can grab the new release at the <a href="/downloads">usual location</a>!
